## Version History Summary

| Version | Release Date | Key Features |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1.0.0 | 2025-06-14 | Production-ready release with full feature set |

## Breaking Changes

### From 0.9.0 to 1.0.0

- Refactored service layer architecture (requires dependency injection updates)
- Updated database connection configuration (requires connection string updates)
- Enhanced error handling (may affect existing error handling code)

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to 1.0.0

1. Update connection strings to use new configuration format
2. Install new NuGet packages for dependency injection
3. Update any custom code to use new service interfaces
4. Run database migrations: `dotnet ef database update`

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

- Windows-only application (planned: cross-platform support)
- Single-user application (planned: multi-user support)
- Basic reporting (planned: advanced analytics)

### Workarounds

- For multi-user scenarios, use shared database with proper access controls
- For advanced reporting, export data to Excel or BI tools

## Support and Maintenance

- **LTS Support**: Version 1.0.0 will receive security updates for 24 months
- **Bug Fixes**: Critical bugs will be patched within 7 days
- **Feature Updates**: Minor releases every 3 months, major releases annually
